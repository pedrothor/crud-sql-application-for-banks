# crud-sql-application-for-banks
i developed a CRUD application for banks using Python and MySQL database. If you decide to create an account, you are going to be with $ 0 (zero) of bank account balance, but you'll receive $ 100 in your credit account. You can make deposits, withdrawals, transfer money to another account and search accounts by ID. If you don't have money, you can use your limit to do what you want to.
