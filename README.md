# crud-sql-application-for-banks
i developed a CRUD application for banks using Python and MySQL database. If you decide to create an account, you are going to be with $ 0 (zero) of bank account balance,
but you'll receive $ 100 in your limit account. You can make a deposit, withdrawals, transfer money to another client and search accounts by ID. If you don't have money, 
you can use your limit to do what you want to.
